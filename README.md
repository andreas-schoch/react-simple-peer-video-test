# WebRTC Examples made with React ([Demo](https://andreas-schoch.github.io/react-webrtc-examples/))
Multiple hacked together examples on how to connect two peers using WebRTC (with and without wrapper libraries).
It is possible to establish connections across the internet with these examples but beware that **no signaling server is involved!**
The necessary information (SDP, ICE Candidates, etc.) will be displayed but needs to be exchanged manually.  

This project was only made to learn and experiment with webrtc.
